# project-dayea
A password manager that helps you remember those secret keys using memory principles.

## Motivation
Q: _Do you reuse passwords?_
If yes, then you might have a problem if one of your accounts are compromised.
**Solution**: Use different passwords for every account

Q: _Are your passwords predictable_?
Then dedicated hackers and people (_familiar enough with you_) with ill intent might be able to guess and eventually compromise your accounts.
**Solution**: Use outragous passwords that are vastly different from each other and have no simple predictable patterns. Maybe use long absurd passphrases or use password generators

Q: _Do you use a bunch of long complicated passwords or passphrases?_
Then you might forget some of them, especially the less used ones and lose access to your accounts forever!
**Solution**: Store your passwords locally, like in a piece of paper or phone notes

Q: _Do you store your password in a piece of paper or a local storage_
Then if you lose your phone / notebook, then you might lose access to your accounts forever! Also, you might forget your notes sometimes and occassionally get locked out of your account in crucial situations!
**Solution**: Use a cloud-based password manager

Q: _Do you use a cloud-based password manager?_
Then what happens if the developers are not vigilent enough, or somehow due to some mistake, the database got compromised and hackers were able to steal **all** your account passwords? What happens if there's a blackout or lack of internet? Then you might still lose access to your account!
**Solution**: A combination of the above **+ Project Dayea**, a local password manager that also helps you remember your password using memory principles!

## Introduction
Project Dayea is a program that stores (_and encrypts of course_) your password, while also acting as a sort of memory game that focuses on active recall, space repetition, and muscle memory.

There is no better way of securing your password except by making it long and _complicated_. If it's only long, then it might be susceptible to dictionary attacks. If it's only complicated, then it might be cracked down by sheer brute force. But if it's both, then you'll be safe from hackers (except when the devs do not give importance to security or if by some chance, our little hackers are actually mathematical geniuses that can solve problems teams of experts cannot solve, or are actually prodigy inventors that were able to create state-of-the-art working quantum computers that can exponentially crack passwords than current technology).

However, a long and complicated password does have a problem, it's easier to forget! Unless, you're a person with near-perfect memory, then you're likely just like the average person that forgets their password, especially when they have a _bunch_ of them!

Luckily, although we might not be born with perfect memory, we can still exert effort to make some of memory _long-lasting_ (you still know your name, don't you?). This is where Dayea comes in.

_TO-DO: Do the Docs_

## Installation

Make sure that you have the latest Python version and using the terminal, go to the directory of the project and enter the following code:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Currently, it still uses the terminal so just run:

```bash
python dayea.py
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Create a basic encryption/decryption module
- [x] Add support for multiple account passwords
- [ ] Create a GUI

## Support

If there are any concerns or problems, please don't hesistate to raise an issue!

Also, you can contact me using themikosurara@gmail.com (maybe you can give me a free drink).

## Contributing

I don't think I'll accept for now, but you can always make a Pull Request and hit me up with your suggested edits, but I'm likely to look into it for now (still quite busy with studies).
